**🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using CNN**

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories. It is designed as a practical deep learning project for healthcare applications, demonstrating skills in image preprocessing, CNN architecture design, model training, and evaluation.

**🚀 Project Overview**

Built a CNN model from scratch using Tensorflow.

Trained on publicly available Brain MRI dataset.

Implemented image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation).

Evaluated performance using training and testing accuracy.


**⚙️ Tech Stack**

Language: Python 🐍

Libraries: Tensorflow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

Tools: Git, VS Code

**📊 Results**

Achieved ~95% accuracy on test set.

CNN successfully differentiates between all the classes mentioned.
